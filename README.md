Seth Roberts was an early self-experimenter who developed this script as a way to measure "brain reaction time", which he believed was correlated with many important aspects of health and well-being.

How to get started
------------------

You'll need to load this script in an R environment.

Then type this to get started:

``` r
> me()
```

This will open a window with a menu of additional instructions.

Start first with a warmup session and then do the testing session. When finished, the script will print your results to the R console, or you can also show plots with many more data points.

Examples

Seth Roberts published several examples of things he learned from using this app:

And here's a presentation showing more about experiments conducted with this app:
